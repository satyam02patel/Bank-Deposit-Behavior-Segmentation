# Bank-Deposit-Behavior-Segmentation
Spearheaded full-cycle data projects starting from raw data ingestion and preprocessing using Python (Pandas), performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends, outliers, and business-impacting metrics.

Built scalable SQL queries and views to handle complex data transformations, aggregations, and joins, enabling seamless data integration across departments. Ensured data integrity, standardized business logic, and optimized query performance for faster reporting.

Designed and delivered interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize KPIs such as total loans, deposits, account balances, and client segmentation. Enabled stakeholders to track business lending patterns, client loyalty trends, and income-based loan behaviors with slice-and-dice filtering capabilities.

Leveraged multi-source analytics to highlight key patterns-such as higher loan volume from Private Banking, peak savings by age, and loyalty classification influence on location concentration-guiding senior management in credit risk, customer targeting, and financial product strategies.


Insights:
Deposits and Savings Behavior
The high correlation between Bank Deposits and Saving Accounts suggests that these may either measure overlapping financial behavior (e.g., total funds a customer keeps in the bank) or that people who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow savings balances.

Income, Age, and Accumulation
Moderate correlations of Age and Estimated Income with various balances (Superannuation, Savings, Checking) reflect a common financial lifecycle trend: higher income earners and older individuals often accumulate more savings, retirement funds, and may carry higher credit card balances or loans.

Low Correlation with Properties Owned
Property ownership may depend on external factors (location, real estate market conditions, inheritance, etc.) that are not captured by these particular banking variables. Hence, we see weaker correlations here.

Business vs. Personal Banking
Business Lendingâ€™s moderate link to Bank Loans suggests some customers may have both personal and business debts. However, business lending is relatively uncorrelated with other deposit or property-related metrics, indicating it may serve a distinct subset of customers or needs.
